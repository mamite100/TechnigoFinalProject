# TechnigoFinalProject
This is my final project at the Technigo Bootcamp. A full MERN Stack web-app. 
# Process
I started out by making a overview in Figma. Figma is a very usefull tool to plan pages, components, and endpoints. 
The codeing process started by setting up most of the backend and then add the frontend functionality.
